# A Synthetix Reboot

## Abstract

This proposal outlines a plan to overhaul and improve Synthetix’s governance and performance. Additionally, it touches on a vision forward for Synthetix to regain prominence and significance within crypto and DeFi. Its primary aim is to reinvigorate the Synthetix ecosystem and return it to relevance, importance, and prominence within the DeFi ecosystem.

**The outcome of this proposal should reflect the will of the token holder.** Should token holders share similar frustrations at the project’s direction this last 12 months, the limited communications, the lack of vision (has anyone seen a 2024 roadmap?) and the continued delays in development, this proposal provides an opportunity to act and create change.

**Change is necessary** - Synthetix continues to lose relevance in markets, SNX continues to underperform crypto and DeFi, protocol stats continue to sink, deadlines continue to run over, and community frustrations and disappointment are voiced daily in Discord. There is little evidence to suggest that things will fix themselves in their current state. It’s time to rattle the cage, implement changes and establish a vision and roadmap that will give Synthetix the best chance to return to prominence and status as a DeFi OG. 

When an otherwise perfectly fine and performing system starts failing, more often than not, the solution is to unplug the system, and restart it with a software update.

The Synthetix project is failing. Not on performance alone, but it is fading into obscurity and is at risk of becoming a zombie protocol that will live on only as hopium for a select few devoted followers.

**The Synthetix project is failing.** Not on performance alone, but it is fading into obscurity and is at risk of becoming a zombie protocol that will live on only as hopium for a select few devoted followers.

Synthetix continues to become less relevant in DeFi and risks continuing down a path of irrelevance if things do not change. Synthetix has suffered from:
-	_Delays in development_ which have prevented Synthetix from capturing market narratives, user attention and product adoption – e.g. launch of a perp contract on Ethereum (L1) that Ethena could utilise early in 2024.
-	_Low/no commercialisation focus_ – Synthetix continues to miss the opportunity to make the protocol financially robust, misses grant opportunities, and does not consider economic drivers during product development. This has resulted in missed opportunities for Synthetix to access grants for work (i.e. the 900k ARB grant we just lost), and fee models that are not optimal for project prosperity.
-	_Limited/no accountability_ has meant Governance Councils continue to operate without authority and without adequate incentives to innovate and drive positive change – leading to many Council members largely collecting stipends and blind signing transactions as per CC recommendations.
-	_No marketing efforts_ have succeeded in driving a meaningful increase in perp usage, resulting in low fees and low incentives for new investment in the Synthetix ecosystem.
-	_Inefficiencies_ from a globally distributed team have resulted in low accountability, low transparency on work being conducted, a poor culture of innovation and reduced output. This is resulting in attrition amongst key members of Synthetix Core Contributors.
-	Recently, large SNX holders have lost sight of and _don’t understand what the current vision is_ for Synthetix and what the project’s roadmap is, resulting in confusion and limited/no enthusiasm for the project. If large holders cannot grasp this, neither can the broader market and new potential investors, resulting in poor performance and SNX falling well outside the top 100 crypto projects by market cap.

**This proposal outlines a plan to reset, refresh and reinvigorate the project through streamlining governance, increasing accountability, improving transparency, reinvigorating culture, and aligning key stakeholders.**

Should this proposal be ratified, Synthetix will undergo a significant transformation towards a much more efficient and effective structure with a defined vision, clear objectives, and outcomes, as well as accountability and more transparency to the community. The key short-term (2025) objectives to re-energise Synthetix are listed below. More details can be found in the 2025 Synthetix Vision Statement.
-	Put the SNX token back at the centre of Synthetix via a token redesign
-	Operationalise SnaXchain – add functionality, migrate SNX, launch a new stablecoin
-	Restart work on Synth Teleporters
-	Business development and sales focus to onboard front ends and to build stronger relations with existing integration partners
-	Get Carina (Ethereum Mainnet perps) over the line and finally launched 
-	Deploy Synthetix on Solana
-	V3 perp proliferation
-	Perp V3 expansion and V2x depreciation 

This is not about reinventing the wheel, as some of the above is already included in current plans. This is about implementing a new structure and approach, facilitating a razor-sharp focus on delivering the 2025 vision in a timely manner. Additionally, it’s about bringing fresh ideas and energy to the project to ensure Synthetix continues to be at the forefront of DeFi and crypto markets.

## Motivation

**Synthetix requires an update and reboot** - historically Synthetix has captured market attention and interest, and is truly one of a small handful of projects that can claim to have: 
- Been battle-hardened through two crypto winters - true DeFi OG status
- Processed over $60B of on-chain volumes
- Created crypto primitives or been instrumental in innovation (e.g. liquidity farming, early support of OP, on-chain governance, industry low fees, neutral skew decentralised perp markets, etc)
- Built infra that is an integral part of several other protocols (e.g. Kwenta, Lyra, Thales).

However, over the last year, the SNX token has underperformed as crypto markets have recovered in the wake of the 2022 bear market. Underperformance against its peers has seen SNX slip from challenging to be in the top 50 assets by market cap to falling closer towards a ranking of 150. This underperformance risks Synthetix falling out of relevance and becoming a forgotten product/token. This can translate into a negative feedback loop where low attention → lower volumes → lower SNX price → lower attention → repeat. This can be very hard to ever recover from and needs to be rectified immediately.

Many different paths could have been taken but the current path is one of irrelevance and potential ruin. But there is still time to salvage the project - especially if rapid and swift action is taken. Synthetix cannot simply rely on its Defi OG status to stay relevant, it needs to bring back the focus on innovation and get the attention it deserves.

Several drastic changes need to be made to achieve this. Below lists several of the more prominent current issues in the project and proposed changes required to address them. 

## Specification

Synthetix needs a more succinct vision and an execution plan that allows it to operate as the de facto suite of smart contracts that powers decentralised derivatives marketplaces.

To do so, Synthetix needs to re-establish itself as a leader in the DeFi ecosystem by:
- Efficiently developing and maintaining a scalable and sustainable protocol for creating and trading synthetic assets.
- Continuously innovating to meet evolving market demands.
- Fostering a thriving ecosystem of developers, traders and liquidity providers.
- Promoting financial inclusion and accessibility.
- Ensuring the long-term robustness and sustainability of Synthetix governance.

But to do so – it is my strong belief that Synthetix requires a reboot. There needs to be some significant changes in the short-term to address current issues whilst developing a plan to execute on the longer term vision. 

### Identification of several of the key issues

Below is a list of issues that are perceived to be at the core of Synthetix underperformance in recent times
1.	**No market attention** – the primary issue is that no matter what progress takes place, Synthetix must find a way to maintain awareness and attention - Crypto is an attention game. Without attention marketability is low and no matter what progress is made, solution adoption is lacklustre and progress doesn’t result in more usage. 
2.	**There is a lack of accountability** - while decentralised governance is extremely powerful when it comes to community alignment and coordinating protocol changes, ownership of outcomes is also critical and the current structure is antithetical to this. At the start of the year, a proposal was made to deprecate the contributor committee and replace it with a contributor lead, unfortunately whilst this was probably a step in the right direction, it didn’t go far enough to achieve the required outcomes.   
3.	**There has been mass attrition of contributors over the last six months resulting in output slowing and less proactive development (more reactive)** - One of the most critical initiatives of the last 12 months, the L1 perp, has taken over a year to deliver, missing out on tailwinds from the carry trade narrative early in 2024 that has now closed. Network expansion has progressed, and the Base/Arbitrum launches were a big milestone, however Synthetix must be able to deliver innovation in a timely manner to capitalise on critical market opportunities. 
4.	**There has been a limited (maybe no?) commercialisation consideration placed on several product decisions recently** – Synthetix just lost a 900k ARB grant to incentivise usage on Arbitrum. Despite doing all the work and launching on ARB. Rather than accessing almost $500k to incentivise users to try Synthetix based derivatives markets, the project now has to cold start and compete against the incumbents GMX and Gains Network. When approached by a multi billion dollar protocol (Ethena) to build a product (Ethereum Mainnet perps), limited (maybe no) prioritisation was placed on development and additional capacity was not hired for. As such, it’s widely considered this opportunity has been lost. These are just two of many misses that have cost Synthetix money and opportunity over the last 12 months.

### Short Term Changes Required to Reboot
To address the aforementioned key identified issues within Synthetix, the below suggestions outline several structural changes that to take place during the remainder of 2024. This is in tandem with reprioritisation of project objectives and continuation of the work currently being conducted to further the protocol (e.g. Ethereum Mainnet perp development).

#### A refreshed vision and roadmap for Synthetix

From the outside and from feedback amongst non-Synthetix investors, it seems like there has been a loss of focus and direction. New participants are unlikely to have heard of Synthetix and once aware are unsure what the project wishes to accomplish.

A new and refreshed roadmap / vision needs to be produced and socialised. This will help realign the efforts of key stakeholders (i.e. the Spartan Council, contributors, community members and integrators) and allow the external non-Synthetix community to better understand what path the project is on.

Once the vision and roadmap are established, a streamlined communication plan should be designed, to create a more succinct vision, roadmap, and message for the market. This will include engaging with key front ends and products that can leverage Synthetix contracts to build awareness, increase integrations and further engrain Synthetix across the crypto ecosystem.

Forming a working group with a robust marketing function to execute on this and continue to drive the messaging is critical.

#### Formation of a new Spartan Council 

The existing governance model of 17 members across 3 Councils isn’t working. In its current form, councillors have limited accountability, no clearly defined roles or responsibilities, limited engagement with CCs and next to no ability to influence decisions in a timely manner. As a result, Synthetix is lacking clear direction in development, cohesion in efforts and effectiveness in execution. 

Proposed changes are as follows:
-	Synthetix will remain a DAO that the SNX token holders govern.
-	The new governance model will combine a bounded delegate system. All existing councils will be consolidated into a new Spartan Council consisting of 7 delegates, each with equal voting power.
-	Founding constituents of the Spartan Council will be:
⋅⋅* Strategy Seat – Benjamin Celermajer
⋅⋅* Technical Seat – TBC 
⋅⋅* Ops Seat – Cav
⋅⋅* Treasury Seat – Russel Gordon (OG Spartan)
⋅⋅* Advisory Seat 1 – Jordan Momtazi (OG Spartan)
⋅⋅* Advisory Seat 2 – Spartan Glory (OG Spartan)
⋅⋅* Advisory Seat 3 – Kain (Founder / OG Spartan)
-	All seats will carry an equal voting weight of 1.00
-	Multisig signing for SIPs, SCCPs, STPs and Treasury Transactions will continue similar to how it has historically, just conducted by a single Council. All SIP/SCCP, STPs and Treasury Transactions will require 5/7 signatures to be approved.
-	The only exception will be that the Treasury Seat will be a required signer of all STPs and Treasury transactions, continuing to maintain Treasury independence from the broader Project.
-	The Treasury Seat and 3x Advisory Seats are elected by governance voting.
-	The Strategy, Technical and Ops seats are not elected by community governance. These seats are hired by the elected seats and form the leadership team of Synthetix. This ensures the council has full project context when making decisions, helps maintain project consistency across epochs and ensures a point of ultimate accountability for the progress of Synthetix.
-	Elect seats have the power to hire/replace the non-elect seats (via council vote).
-	Elected Seats will have a 6-month term, with elections to be held in the first two weeks of every October and April.
-	For the first epoch, stipends will remain as they have been for previous Council members (i.e. 2,000 SNX per month), with a review to be conducted and a potentially new proposed incentive model moving forward. This will generate savings of 20,000 SNX per month for the Treasury.
-	The pDAO will continue to validate, stage, and execute upgrades to Synthetix in the short term with scope to reconsider alternate models (e.g. Risk Council as proposed in SIP-401).

This proposed model has been designed to ensure key responsibilities are directly delegated to council members for which they are ultimately accountable. A consolidated council function will be nimbler, enact more rapid change and engage more actively with key stakeholders across the Synthetix protocol.

#### Identification, Formation and Operationalisation of Core Working Groups
There is a lot of work to be done across many different workstreams to return Synthetix to its former glory days. To do so in an efficient and effective way, core working groups will be defined and formed. Under this proposal and the attached vision, Synthetix will require several functions such as sales, customer support, analytics, development, etc. As previously mentioned, the CC model of hiring over 20 globally remote individuals is resulting in mass inefficiencies.  

Each working group’s function, roles and responsibilities will be directly aligned with the Synthetix 2025 vision. Importantly, Working Groups will be held accountable for delivery of core workstreams and report to the Spartan Council. 

To overcome this, Working Group members will be co-located in the same time zone(s) to create an environment where team culture can grow, turnaround and iteration of work is rapid, team cohesion is strong, members become more accountable to one another, etc. One will be hired and operate out of Sydney, Australia with my oversight, with scope for another one (initially at least) in an additional location.

Additionally, the formation of these working groups will allow for a contributor resync. Whilst work is being done, a critical development path needs to be established, communicated, and focused on to achieve core project milestones and work towards an end game for Synthetix.

#### Launch the Synthetix Foundation
Having an entity domiciled in a crypto friendly jurisdiction has many benefits. It enables Synthetix to:
-	Sign contracts with partners, potential integrators and investors
-	Have a contracting entity for domain services, cloud services, email services
-	Engage with smart contracts that require a signing entity for KYC/AML (alpha?!)
-	Take receipt of partner incentives that require receipt from a signing entity
-	Etc
This is simply aligning to the latest DAO approach adopted by the vast majority of ‘new’ crypto projects.

### Next Steps

-	Hold a town hall in discord to discuss the motivations for this change and the referendum with the Community
-	Vote for the referendum on snapshot

Should the referendum fail
-	Carry on as is – no change.

Should this referendum be approved and ratified by a community vote:
-	Hand over governance to the new council members
-	Hand over Treasury Multisig to the new council members
-	Hand over governance wallets (from Ambassadors) to the new council members
-	Engage legal representation to establish a Synthetix Foundation
-	Realign existing operations with the Synthetix 2025 vision
-	Conduct a review of current operations and processes
-	Release a 30-day report to the community on the transition
